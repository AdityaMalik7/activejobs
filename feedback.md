# General

1. Always put hardcoded raw data like `activeJobs` in a separate file.

2. DO NOT REPEAT. Make things as much dynamic as possible. For ex: You can map all the types from `activeJobs` to render the buttons dynamically. Done for you in App.js. Kindly take a look.

3. Use React Icons for icons instead of utf-8 icons as those are not standard for all the browsers.
